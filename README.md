# Question: How do you design a parking lot system with entry, exit, and slot tracking? C# Summary

The C# code provided is a simple console application that simulates a parking lot system with entry, exit, and slot tracking. The ParkingLot class has three private variables: capacity, slotCount, and availableSlots. The capacity variable represents the total number of parking slots in the parking lot, slotCount keeps track of the number of currently occupied slots, and availableSlots is a queue that stores the numbers of all available slots. The ParkingLot constructor initializes these variables and fills the availableSlots queue with all slot numbers. The ParkCar method is used to park a car. It checks if there is any available slot (by comparing slotCount with capacity), increments the slotCount, and returns the number of the assigned slot (by dequeuing from availableSlots). If the parking lot is full, it returns -1. The RemoveCar method is used to remove a car from a slot. It decrements the slotCount and enqueues the number of the freed slot back to availableSlots. The Main method in the Program class demonstrates the usage of the ParkingLot class by creating a parking lot with 5 slots, parking cars until the lot is full, removing a car from slot 2, and then parking more cars.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution is similar to the C# version in terms of the overall logic and approach. Both versions use a queue-like data structure to keep track of available parking slots and a counter to keep track of the number of parked cars. However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions.

1. Data Structures: In the C# version, a Queue is used to keep track of available slots, while in Python, a list is used. Python does not have a built-in Queue data structure like C#, but lists in Python can be used as queues by using the append() and pop(0) methods.

2. Initialization: In the C# version, the available slots are initialized in the constructor using a for loop. In Python, the list of available slots is initialized using the range() function, which generates a list of numbers from 0 to size-1.

3. Method Definitions: In C#, methods are defined using the 'public' keyword followed by the return type, method name, and parameters. In Python, methods are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the method name and parameters. Python methods do not specify a return type.

4. String Formatting: In C#, string concatenation is used to print messages to the console. In Python, f-strings are used, which allow for embedding expressions inside string literals.

5. Error Handling: In the C# version, the ParkCar method returns -1 when the parking lot is full. In the Python version, a message is printed to the console and None is returned.

6. The Python version also includes a status method that prints the current status of all slots in the parking lot, which is not present in the C# version.

7. The Python version also includes the vehicle's information in the parking lot, which is not present in the C# version.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution is more detailed and complex than the C# version. It introduces two additional classes, `Car` and `Slot`, to represent the cars and parking slots respectively. This makes the solution more object-oriented and allows for more detailed tracking of the parking lot status.

In the Java version, each `Car` has a registration number and driver age, and each `Slot` can hold a `Car` object. The `ParkingLot` class in Java uses an array of `Slot` objects, and each `Slot` can be either free or occupied by a `Car`. The `parkCar` method in Java version parks a car in the first free slot it finds, and the `removeCar` method removes a car from a specific slot.

In contrast, the C# version is simpler and does not have separate classes for cars and slots. It uses a `Queue` to keep track of available slots, and a simple integer counter to keep track of the number of parked cars. The `ParkCar` method in C# version dequeues an available slot and increments the counter, and the `RemoveCar` method enqueues a slot and decrements the counter.

The Java version also includes a `getParkingLotStatus` method that prints the status of all slots in the parking lot, which is not present in the C# version.

In terms of language features, both versions make use of similar features in their respective languages, such as classes, methods, loops, and conditionals. The C# version uses a `Queue` from the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace, while the Java version uses an array and does not require any additional imports. The Java version also makes use of the `System.out.println` method for printing to the console, while the C# version uses `Console.WriteLine`.
